# Job Posting Guidelines

While enabling recruitment _isn't_ a primary goal of React Brisbane, we do have processes in place!

**The TLDR of this guide is:**

> React Brisbane _does_ accomodate **transparent** job ads.
> React Brisbane _doesn't_ accomodate opaque or vague recruitment.

## :gem: "Transparent" Job Ads

This boils down to **disclosing** the name behind the job ad!

There needs to be a _clear and deliberate connection_ between the job ad, the entity behind it, and React Brisbane.

### Examples

##### Deliberate company name disclosure and job details :thumbsup:

_These are provided as examples - we aren't attributed to the companies :)._

* [Front End Developer at ABC News](https://github.com/BrisJS/meetups/issues/267)
* [Senior Software Engineer at Stacktrace](https://github.com/BrisJS/meetups/issues/269)

##### "Opaque" or "vague" recruitment messages :no_entry_sign:

_These show a distinct disconnect from the community._

> "Hey all, I am looking for a frontend developer with react experience. Kindly check ( recruit.biz/developer-catch-all ) for more details."

> "Hey Peeps,Full Stack role available. Stack Laravel/React. Min 3 years commercial exp with PHP. email smith@recruit.biz thanks"
